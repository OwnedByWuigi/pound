## Overview

Join the [**Pound Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/aMmTmKsVC7)!

**Pound** is an early-stage emulator for the **Nintendo Switch 2**, targeting **Android**, **macOS** (Intel and ARM), **Windows**, and **Linux** (Intel and ARM).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Pound is still in early development — don't expect miracles.

Initial focus is on implementing the **CPU**, leveraging its architectural similarities to the original Nintendo Switch. Later stages will address differences in hardware between the two console generations.


## How to Compile Pound

See the [**compilation guide**](/docs/compguide.md) for detailed instructions.


## Codebase

Pound reuses selected components from existing Nintendo Switch 1 emulators, primarily **Yuzu**.  
All third-party code is clearly documented and properly attributed in the relevant parts of the repository.
